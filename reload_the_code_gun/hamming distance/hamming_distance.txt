Given two serials of numbers k,m consist of only 0's and 1's .

Compare each bit by bit in order and print numbers bit of bits differ from each other

input format:
First two lines consist of two binary numbers.

Output format:
Print number of bits differ from each from each other

Note: input will be given in 0's and 1's Only

Sample test:
input:

101
111

Output:

1


Sample test 2:

input:

011
100

Output:

3



Python:

c=0
k=input()
m=input()
for i in range(0,len(k)):
    if(k[i]!=m[i]):
        c=c+1
print(c)
